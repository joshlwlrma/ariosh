         <h2> <a href="https://www.programiz.com/html/online-compiler/"> CSS </a> </h2> 
        <p> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that defines the presentation of HTML or XML documents. It uses selectors to target elements and properties to define visual aspects like color and layout. Values are assigned to properties to specify how they should be applied. The "cascading" nature allows styles to be prioritized based on factors like specificity and source order. CSS employs the box model, treating every element as a box with content, padding, border, and margin. It is crucial for controlling the layout of web pages, enabling developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs, thus enhancing the overall user experience of a website. CSS is typically used in conjunction with HTML to separate document structure from presentation, promoting maintainability and flexibility.         </p>
         <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in October 1994 during his work at CERN with Tim Berners-Lee. Influenced by discussions within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), CSS aimed to provide style sheets for the web. The first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) was released in 1996, with significant contributions from co-author Bert Bos.</p>

        <p>CSS's purpose was to allow documents to be influenced by multiple style sheets through "cascading" styles. Earlier style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were considered unsuitable for web requirements. As HTML evolved to include more stylistic capabilities, the need for enhanced web presentation capabilities grew.        </p>
        <p> The separation of structure and presentation became a key focus, leading to discussions on the www-style mailing list about nine style sheet language proposals. Notable among them were Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP). Lie implemented CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser, and Bos implemented SSP in the Argo browser. Lie and Bos collaborated to develop the CSS standard, presenting it at conferences in 1994 and 1995.         </p>
        <p> The W3C became involved in CSS development, organizing a workshop that resulted in CSS being added to the deliverables of the HTML Editorial Review Board. In August 1996, Netscape introduced an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS), but it was deprecated. CSS became the official standard with the publication of the CSS level 1 Recommendation in December 1996.         </p>
        <p> Subsequent developments included the creation of CSS level 2 in 1997 and ongoing work on CSS level 3 from 1998 to 2014. The CSS Working Group, formed within the HTML Editorial Review Board, addressed issues not covered by CSS level 1.         </p>
        <p> In 2005, the CSS Working Groups enforced stricter standards, leading to the reevaluation of published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text. These standards were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.         </p>
        <h2>Is CSS Useful? </h2>
        <p> CSS is incredibly useful in web development. CSS is a style sheet language that is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows developers to control the layout, appearance, and design of web pages. CSS is a fundamental technology in web development, playing a crucial role in creating visually appealing, responsive, and maintainable websites. Learning and using CSS effectively is essential for anyone involved in web design and development.          </p>

       <table> 
        <tr> 
        <th>Advantage</th> 
        <th>Disadvantage</th> 
        </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Consistency & Maintenance:
            One of the greatest advantages of CSS is its consistency. Since it is consistent, the developer does not have to put in a lot of effort. The formatting can be changed easily and the changes made get reflected to the web pages using that style sheet. CSS is also very easy to maintain.            
            </td> 
        <td>Learning Curve:
            Although CSS is an easy language to learn, some of its syntax is quite complicated. There are also different levels of CSS like CSS1, CSS2, and CSS3. They are different from each other in a few aspects.             
            </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Flexibility:
            A greater flexibility can be achieved using CSS. It is compatible with both big and small screens. A responsive design can be created using CSS which is the best fit for all types of screens.            
            </td>
        <td>Complex Layouts:
            If there is a complex layout, it might be difficult to create the same using CSS. There can be several intricacies that might arise due to the position and responsiveness.            
            </td>            
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Enhanced Design Options:
            CSS can style the web pages with a variety of styles. While using only HTML, a plain and basic web page can be created. A visually appealing web page can be created using CSS. 
            </td>            
        <td>Over Specificity
            Over-specificity is an issue in CSS where the selectors are defined as having a lot of levels. In the case of nested selectors or over-specified selectors, the code is not quite readable and it is difficult to make changes.
