         <h2> <a href="https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/"> JAVASCRIPT </a> </h2> 
         <p>JavaScript is a scripting language and one of the core languages used in website development. While HTML and CSS provide structure and style to a website, JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity, enabling visitors to interact with content in various ways. JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, running within the user's browser. However, the introduction of Node.js has extended its capabilities to server-side execution as well.         </p>
           <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications in 1995. Initially known as LiveScript, its name was later changed to JavaScript. The language was designed as a scripting language for Netscape Navigator, the company's flagship web browser. The decision to name it JavaScript was strategic, positioning it as a companion to the Java language, which was a product of Netscape's partner, Sun Microsystems. Despite some superficial syntactic similarities, JavaScript is not related to the Java programming language.</p>
    <p> In its early days, JavaScript faced performance and security issues, and it wasn't initially regarded as a serious programming language. However, as more browsers started adding JavaScript support, developers had no alternative if they wanted to run programs in the browser.       
        <p>The release of Node.js by Ryan Dahl further expanded JavaScript's capabilities by providing a way to run JavaScript code outside the browser. This liberation from the browser's confines contributed to JavaScript's current popularity. Today, JavaScript is used to write various applications, including browser, server, mobile, and desktop applications. Major online companies like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google incorporate JavaScript into their products.        </p>
        <p> A significant turning point occurred in 2008 with the introduction of Google's open-source Chrome V8, a high-performance JavaScript engine. This led to the development of fast JavaScript engines, enabling the creation of sophisticated browser-based applications with performance comparable to desktop and mobile applications.         </p>
        <h2>Is JAVASCRIPT Useful? </h2>
    <p> JavaScript's most popular use is for web development, and it is one of the most powerful tools a developer can have on their toolbelt. Developers use JavaScript in web development to add interactivity and features to improve the user experience and make the internet much more enjoyable.</p>

        <tr> 
        <th>Advantage</th> 
        <th>Disadvantage</th> 
        </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Easier Code: 
            The complexity of codes for any application has always been the biggest challenge for developers worldwide. Javascript has resolved this problem to a huge extent by providing the facility of interpreting code directly on the user’s machine.             
            </td> 
        <td>Security Threat: 
            As javascript interprets directly on the client-side it always has a possibility of transmitting any harmful trojan or bug over the host’s machine, making javascript a security threat for the system.            
            </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Fast Processing: 
            One of the most promising advantages of javascript is its speed of processing. The javascript executes with lightning speed because it is being interpreted directly on the host’s machine and does not require any server for its compilation as java does.
            </td>
        <td>No Testing: 
            The javascript code is executed directly over the host’s machine which disables the debugging or testing of source code. It sometimes results in execution errors on the client-side.
            </td>            
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Global Acceptance: 
            Javascript, because of its countless facilities such as fast processing, accuracy, independence from the server, easier code, user friendly and uniformity, etc, has become the most widely accepted scripting language throughout the world. 
            </td> 
        <td>Safety of Code: 
            Javascript never hides the source code and gives the public access to it, which means the source code of javascript is always visible to all and compromises the safety of the source code.
