         <h2> <a href="https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/"> C++ </a> </h2> 
        <p>C++ is a versatile programming language used for a wide range of applications, supporting object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms. It allows programmers to organize data and code in a comprehensible manner, with the coding platform or compiler translating it into machine-readable instructions. This versatility enables C++ to be employed in diverse contexts, making it suitable for writing nearly anything that runs on a computer. One of the key advantages of C++ is code reusability, allowing developers to save time by leveraging previously written code. The language also enables the creation of complex functions by combining data and instructions into classes, facilitating the implementation of sophisticated functionalities not easily achievable in other programming languages.
        </p>
         <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p> The origins of C++ lie in the programming language known as C, which was developed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1970. C was created for writing operating systems code using simple procedure-oriented language and was an incredibly popular coding language at the time.

            The only issue with C was the fact that, because it was procedure-oriented, programmers had to first describe the data when coding and then write procedures to manipulate it, which was quite time-consuming and confusing. To solve this problem, a new method of object-oriented coding emerged that grouped data together with operations that worked on them.
            </p>
        <p> In the 1980s, a man called Bjarne Stroustrup working at Bell Labs in the United States started to develop an improved version of the C programming language that he called ‘C with classes’. This was because it was an object-oriented language, where the groups of data are also referred to as ‘objects’ or ‘classes’.
            </p>
        <p> Stroustrup wanted a new type of code that was fast and efficient but could also produce complex, high-level features that could be used in large software development projects. The C++ programming language was born from his work, allowing data to be organised and processed much better than the majority of other languages.
            </p>
        <p> Since its original development, the C++ language has been updated and refined to include new features that improve the code and what you can do with it.
        </p>
        <h2>Is CSS Useful? </h2>
        <p> C++ is still widely useful for a variety of reasons. It is known for its high performance, making it suitable for systems programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. C++ is also used in developing software for embedded systems, operating systems, and large-scale applications where efficiency and control over hardware are important. Additionally, C++ has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile language for various domains.

        <th>Disadvantage</th> 
        </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Portability: 
            Programs written in C++ can often be executed on other platforms without any further ado. This is especially the case when the C++ code follows a compiler-independent standard.                        
            </td> 
        <td>Complex:
            Writing programs in C++ can be challenging, especially for developers more familiar with the niceties of modern programming languages. For one thing, modern languages often take care of a lot of details for you, details that C++ requires you to manually implement and keep track of.

    </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Low-Level Control, High-Level Features: 
            C++ is considered a middle-level language because of its combination of low-level and high-level features. C++ gives developers low-level control for things like memory manipulation. 
            </td>
        <td>Lack of Support for Multiple Threads:
            So far, C++ still does not have any built-in support for multi-threaded applications. Although C++ is adding support for threads, it is severely lacking when compared to languages like Java.

    </tr> 
    <tr> 
        <td>Efficiency:
            C++ runs close to metal, meaning that it runs close to hardware limits. This makes C++ programs capable of running faster and lighter than programs in many other languages.            
            </td>            
        <td>Unsafe: 
            Because of the low-level memory management mentioned above, C++ programs tend to be considered unsafe from a memory perspective. C++’s use of pointers and its potential for incorrect typing of variables can lead to memory
